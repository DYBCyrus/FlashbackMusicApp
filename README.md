# FlashbackMusicApp

## Inspiration
We want the application to "memorize" the listening patterns of every unique user. Also, we want to enbale users to share songs based on location and time instantaneously.

## What it does
This is an Android application to let people listen to music, create their own friends list, share music to nearby friends, etc. The two most significant features are that, firstly, the app is trying to keep a copy of listening history on the backend and suggesting/sorting songs based on the listening frequency ro time. Secondly, friends of one user could see what songs he/she listens or likes most frequently, provided the public profile.

## How we built it
We used Google Play Services, Android Studio, and Firebase to develop the program. We had written user stories, planed for each milestone, had standup meetings every day, implemented unit tests, and so on.

## Challenges we ran into
Google login API was a little tricky to use. We also encountered difficulties while sorting the musics when users switch on the "sharing" mode.

## What we learned
Firebase fundamentals, Google related API implementation, UI/UX designs, design patterns, etc.
